        sqlite3 db_sth.db

        查看生成的表column,尤其是当有关外键时,需要注意有没有生成对应的外键,
        有一些数据类型是无法生成column的,如Date和BigDecimal

    <!--
       Define the database name of your application.
       By default each database name should be end with .db.
       If you didn't name your database end with .db,
       LitePal would plus the suffix automatically for you.
       For example:
       <dbname value="demo" />
   -->
    <!--
        Define the version of your database. Each time you want
        to upgrade your database, the version tag would helps.
        Modify the models you defined in the mapping tag, and just
        make the version value plus one, the upgrade of database
        will be processed automatically without concern.
            For example:
        <version value="1" />
    -->
    <!--
        Define your models in the list with mapping tag, LitePal will
        create tables for each mapping class. The supported fields
        defined in models will be mapped into columns.
        For example:
        <list>
            <mapping class="com.test.model.Reader" />
            <mapping class="com.test.model.Magazine" />
        </list>
    -->

    <!--
            Define where the .db file should be. "internal" means the .db file
            will be stored in the database folder of internal storage which no
            one can access. "external" means the .db file will be stored in the
            path to the directory on the primary external storage device where
            the application can place persistent files it owns which everyone
            can access. "internal" will act as default.
            For example:
            <storage value="external" />
